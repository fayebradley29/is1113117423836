        <h2> Software as a Service (SaaS) - Salesforce</h2>
    
        
            <p>             Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet as a service. 
        Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.
         SaaS applications run on a SaaS providers servers. 
        The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.
        SaaS has since become a widely-used business model with more and more different kinds of applications available via the cloud.
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
        SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. 
        This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support.

        <h2> Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Cloud 9</h2>
        <p>
     	    In the PaaS model: Cloud9 provides a computing platform and/or solution stack typically including operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server. 
        Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. 
        With some PaaS offers, the underlying compute and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand such that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The advantages of PaaS are primarily that it allows for higher-level programming with dramatically reduced complexity; 
        the overall development of the application can be more effective, as it has built-in infrastructure; 
        and maintenance and enhancement of the application is easier. 
        It can also be useful in situations where multiple developers are working on a single project involving parties who are not located nearby.

        <p>
            Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
    	    Infrastructure as a Service contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
    	    IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
    	    An IaaS provider provides policy-based services and is responsible for housing, operating and maintaining the equipment it provides for a client. 
    	 

            Characteristics of IaaS include:

            Automated administrative tasks,
            Dynamic scaling,
            Platform virtualization,
            Internet connectivity.

         <h2> Communications as a Service (CaaS) - Gmail </h2>
         
         <p>
              Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. 
    	    Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. 
    	    
    	    <br/>
    	    <br/>
    	    
    	    The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service. 
    	    CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. 
    	    This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand.
    	    
    	    <br/>
            <br/>
            
            CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. 
            The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. 
            There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.
